## About me

Hi, Iâ€™m Hoyeon Chang. I am currently studying for a Bachelor's degree majoring in Electrical & Computer Engineering, and Biological Sciences at Seoul National University. I am particularly interested in natural language processing and artificial intelligence. My research interests lie in understanding how knowledge can be encoded and transferred, and making multimodal AI. If you want to contact me, please send me an e-mail: retapurayo@snu.ac.kr
