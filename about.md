## About me

Hi, Iâ€™m Hoyeon Chang. I am currently studying for a Bachelor's degree majoring in Electrical & Computer Engineering, and Biological Sciences at Seoul National University. I am particularly interested in natural language processing and artificial intelligence. My research interests lie in understanding how knowledge representations can be encoded, transferred, and used for inference and reasoning. I believe that these understandings can lead us to achieve multimodality and explainability of AI models, which are crucial for safe and reliable AI.
